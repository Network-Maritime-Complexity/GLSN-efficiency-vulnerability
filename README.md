# Assessing the efficiency and vulnerability of global liner shipping network
This repository contains the code and data that support the findings of our article. Note: Data on the GLSN composed of ports and inter-port links and link weights, which is derived from the raw data on world liner shipping services, is also contained in this repository. Raw data on world liner shipping services were provided by a third-party commercial database (Alphaliner, https://www.alphaliner.com/) and were used under the license for the current study, and so are not publicly available.

| **src**          | This folder contains all the scripts used for calculation, including: <br><li> the script "[efficiency.py](https://github.com/Network-Maritime-Complexity/GLSN-efficiency-vulnerability/tree/main/src/efficiency.py)" for calculating the network efficiency, port efficiency and country efficiency. <br><li> the script "[complete_disruption_simulation.py](https://github.com/Network-Maritime-Complexity/GLSN-efficiency-vulnerability/tree/main/src/complete_disruption_simulation.py)" for calculating the criticality of each port and country, the dismantling vulnerability of the network, and the vulnerability of each port and country, under the complete disruptions of ports and countries. <br><li> the script "[partial_disruption_simulation.py](https://github.com/Network-Maritime-Complexity/GLSN-efficiency-vulnerability/tree/main/src/partial_disruption_simulation.py)" for calculating the criticality of each port and country, the dismantling vulnerability of the network, and the vulnerability of each port and country, under the partial disruptions of ports and countries. <br><li> the script "[main.py](https://github.com/Network-Maritime-Complexity/GLSN-efficiency-vulnerability/tree/main/src/main.py)" for realizing all the calculations done by the above three scripts.|
| **output**         | After running a script, results will be saved in this folder. Please find out below How to Use.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# System Requirements

**OS Requirements**

These scripts have been tested on *Windows10* operating system.

**Installing Python on Windows**

Before setting up the package, users should have Python version 3.8 or higher, and several packages set up from Python 3.8. The latest version of python can be downloaded from the official website: <https://www.python.org/>

**Hardware Requirements**

The package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 4 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 8+ GB  
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.4+ GHz/core

# Installation Guide

**Package dependencies**

Users should install the following packages prior to running the code:
```
networkx==2.5.1

numpy==1.21.0

openpyxl==3.0.9

pandas==1.2.5

matplotlib==3.4.2

pyecharts==1.9.0

scipy==1.7.0

seaborn==0.11.0

xlrd==1.2.0
```
For a *Windows10* operating system, users can install the packages as follows:

To install all the packages, open the *cmd* window in the root folder and type:

`pip install -r README.md`

To install only one of the packages, type:

`pip install pandas==1.2.5`

# Demo

The folder "[Demo](https://github.com/Network-Maritime-Complexity/GLSN-efficiency-vulnerability/tree/main/Demo)" has an example data. 

Demo data description:
```
# Routes: 736

# Nodes: 242

# Edges: 1206
```
Please open the *cmd* window in the root folder, then use:

`cd src`

`python partial_disruption_simulation.py`

Note: this script is for testing the code, and one should not try to interpret the results generated during the test process.  

# How to Use

The script [main.py](https://github.com/Network-Maritime-Complexity/GLSN-efficiency-vulnerability/src/main.py) is used realizing all the calculations done by the above three scripts. Open the *cmd* window in the folder “src”, then run the following command:

`python main.py`

The results will be saved in a folder called "output".
